# Plumber End User Licence Agreement

While the language may be friendly, this Licence Agreement (the Licence) is a legally binding agreement between you (the Client, being a sole trader, partnership or company) and the party recognised as having ownership of the software (the Vendor, and the Product, respectively). Presently, the Vendor is Nathan Woulfe, operating as a sole trader under Australian Business Number 76 017 557 607.

Use of the Software constitutes acceptance of the terms included below, by the Client and any employees, unless a separate agreement is reached between the Client and the Vendor. If you don't agree with any of the terms below, don't install the Product.

## Who?

The Product is licenced to the Client for use on the registered domain, and any internal, non-public domains, for the Client's business purposes. Additional domains require additional licences.

Any party wishing to use the Product requires a current, active Licence. Given the Licence model include a free option, this is fair and reasonable, yeah?

## What?

The Licence grants non-transferable and non-exclusive use of the Product. The Licence does not grant rights for duplication, modification, disassembly, transfer, sub-licensing, reverse-engineering, molecular engineering, et al. The Licence is not a support agreement, nor does purchasing a Licence consititute any entitlement to support.

Please do not use the Product in the production or dissemination of nuclear weapons. The Vendor does not want to be associated with any such shenanigans.

The Licence does not grant rights to access the Product's source code, but that is not to say the source code or parts of source code may be made publicly available in the future. The Licence does not constitute ownership in any way, shape or form.

## Copyright

It should go without saying that the Product is protected by any and all relevant copyright and intellectual property laws and treaties, in favour of the Vendor. Per above, the Licence does not constitute ownership or any ownership stake in the Product or any of its component parts.

The internet might be a wild west for copyright infringers, but that doesn't make you a cowboy. Do the right thing.

## Warranty

There is no warranty. The Product is provided AS IS, with the Vendor making no warranties, express or implied, as to the operation of the Product or that it will meet the Clientâ€™s requirements. This is software, there will be bugs, and the risk that comes with those bugs is accepted entirely by the Client

## Limitations and Liability

The Vendor is not liable to you, the Client, in any way, shape or form, for any losses or damages arising from the use, rightly or wrongly, of the Product. In accepting this Licence, the Client accepts the Product was not developed to meet their express requirements and as such must accept sole responsibility for ensuring the Product meets their requirements.

If you, the Client, chose to do the wrong thing, the Vendor is wholly indemnified against any claims, costs, expenses, damages and so forth, that may arise from the Client misusing the Product.

Failure to enforce, or delaying the enforcement the Licence does not constitute waiving of the Vendor's sole rights to enforce the terms of the Licence.

## Termination

Breach this agreement and the Licence will be terminated, provided the Client does not remedy the breach in a timely manner. On termination of this agreement, the Client must uninstall, delete or otherwise remove the Product from all computer equipment in their control.

The Vendor offers the Product in good faith, and assumes, rightly or wrongly, that the Client uses the product in good faith.

The conditions of this Licence operate independently. If a recognised authority rules any clause to be unenforceable, the remaining conditions will continue to be enforced.

## Upgrades and support

The Product is licenced for use on Umbraco version 8, including any future minor releases. Licencing for Umbraco 9 will be assessed if and when that version is released, any may constitute a new licence agreement.

Product support is provided by the Vendor and is not included, implicitly or otherwise, with the purchase of a paid Licence.

The Vendor will address breaking changes introduced by Umbraco upgrades in a timely fashion, but offers no guarantees as to the timeliness of any required bug fixes or the release of the updated Product.

## Phone home

The Product communicates periodically with a server maintained by the Vendor, to establish licence validity. At some point in the future, additional telemetry information may be collected in order to assist development decisions and improve the Product.

No personally identifying information is transmitted, nor will be at any time in the future. This is not Silicon Valley, Plumber is not Pied Piper.

Attempting to disable or intercept the Phone Home request is a violation of the terms of this Licence, and frankly, poor digital citizenship.

## Privacy

The Vendor uses a third party payment provider to manage licencing. The third party collects and stores identifying information in line with its own privacy and data collection policies. The Vendor, as a customer of the payment provider, is bound by the applicable provider policies and has access to that data.

At the date of this agreement, the payment provider is Stripe Payments Australia Pty Ltd A.C.N. 160 180 343.

The Vendor collects no identifying information from Client installations of the Product.

## Law and jurisdiction

The Licence and its component parts are covered by Australian law. The Client and the Vendor agree to the exclusive jurisdiction of the Australian courts. Not that it's every going to come to that, is it?
