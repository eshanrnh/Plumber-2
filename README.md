Plumber adds a heap of useful bits and pieces to Umbraco, to allow multi-staged workflow approval for publish/unpublish actions. 

In the backoffice, the new Workflow section has a documentation tab with detailed explanation of features and processes, or you can [read the documentation here](DOCS.md).

## Get started

### Install via Nuget:

```Install-Package Plumber.Workflow```

Drop [the test license](test.lic) into /App_plugins/Plumber to impersonate the Pro-level license on localhost.
